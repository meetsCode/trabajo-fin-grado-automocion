= Introduction
In this report, we will explore the
various factors that influence fluid
dynamics in glaciers and how they
contribute to the formation and
behaviour of these natural structures.

== un subtitulo
In the case of glaciers, fluid
dynamics principles can be used
to understand how the movement
and behaviour of the ice is
influenced by factors such as
temperature, pressure, and the
presence of other fluids (such as
water).

+ The climate
  - Temperature
  - Precipitation
+ The topography
+ The geology
